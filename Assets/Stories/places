===park===
You walk {|back} into the park. The weather is nice, the wind blows through the trees. On the grass, people are playing a nice guitar tune. In the sky, a pair of birds is flying by. #loc[park] #hide[4]
    * [Look at the trees]
        The wind blowing in the tree reminds you to nature and brings up joyful memories about a lazy sunday you spent together.

        As you listen to the song the people are playing on the guitar, you feel culturally involved but the tune reminds you to a sad moment when you had to say goodbye.

//===bookshop===
//The salesperson greets you {|again} as you enter the bookshop. Your eyes stops on different items, like a bird dictionary, a poster with a cat and a travel guide.

//===museum===
//The museum is {|still} very quiet. As you wander about, you can see some beautiful paintings and nice statues. Your eyes get caught by a visitor.
