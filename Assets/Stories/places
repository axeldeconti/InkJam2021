===park===
You walk {|back} into the park. The weather is nice, the wind blows through the trees. On the grass, people are playing a nice guitar tune. In the sky, a pair of birds is flying by. #loc[park] #hide[4]
    * [Look at the trees]
        The wind blowing in the tree reminds you to nature and brings up joyful memories about a lazy sunday you spent together.
